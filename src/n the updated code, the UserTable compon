n the updated code, the UserTable component checks
if the users array is empty. If there are no users,
it renders a message indicating that no users were found.
Similarly, the UserDetail component checks if the data.
user object is falsy. If there is no user data available,
it renders a message indicating that the user was not found.

By using these conditional statements,
the user table and user details components will only be
displayed when there are users or when user data is available, respectively.
